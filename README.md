# FileOrganizer
For the program to work, you need to be running main.py prior to downloading the file you want to sort, 
then once successfully downloaded, the program detects a change, and sort the file accordingly.
The purpose of this program is to sort downloaded files into their respective directories using their file types as an indicator.
This program was inspired by  "Internet made coder" on Youtube.
